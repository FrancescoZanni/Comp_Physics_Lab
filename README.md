# Laboratory of Computational Physics
Repository created for a cource on computational physics. 

The aim of the course final was to estimate the energy of the fundamental state and the first energy gap (defined as the difference between the energy of the first excited state and the fundamental state) using an hybrid Monte Carlo tecnique based on a path-integral approach to the problem.

The repository contatins some of the MATLAB code used for the computation as well as the PDF file for the final essay.
